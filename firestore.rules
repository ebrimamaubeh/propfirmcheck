/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the prop firm directory application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to all prop firm documents. Write access is not granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is stored in the top-level `/prop_firms/{propFirmId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is not supported.
 * - All prop firm data is considered public; therefore, read access is open.
 * - Write access is denied to all users.
